##My wordpress theme development setup

`grunt-cli` tool is required, it can be installed with `npm`, [NodeJS Package Manager](http://nodejs.org/).

After Node/npm is installed on your system run:

`$ npm install`

and

`$ grunt flow`

The sass files will be compiled, and the css autoprefixed and minified.

Copy the contents of the `.env-sample` file and changed the variable to match your server information.
